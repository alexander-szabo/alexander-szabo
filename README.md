Hello! I am a M.Eng student at Cornell Tech studying Operations Research and Information Engineering. Previously I worked as a Business Analyst at CarMax, where I had significant Data Science and Analytics exposure in various business contexts.

My interests lie mainly in the applications of Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and NLP, and will be taking courses covering Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and many other topics.
